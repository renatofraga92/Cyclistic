# Cyclistic
My Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Course

Scenario:

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

# Solution

The Cyclistic company is looking for answers... The finance team have come to the conclusion that the annual membership clients are more
profitable than the casual ones. So the main question is: How to convert these casual riders into membership clients?

First things first. Let's look at some data and recognize how they behave, look for differences and similarities on how they use the service.

To have a first contact with the data set, let's simply open it with Microsoft Excel

The table contains the folllowing columns::
ride_id	rideable_type	started_at	ended_at	start_station_name	start_station_id	end_station_name	end_station_id	start_lat	start_lng	end_lat	end_lng	member_casual

Let's start comparing casual vs annual members::

We've got 52,02 % of annual members and we're aiming to increase this number.

Let's look for some patterns between those.

There are 3 main variables we can analyze to get our answers:
- Type of bycicle (There are 3)
- Duration of the ride
- Distance traveled

First, we gonna clean the data. We have the initial and end date/time of the trip, but not the total duration. Lets include this important information,
as well as, the distance of the trip. We're given the lat and lgt of the ride, but not the total distance. We must include those informations by doing some
calculations.
