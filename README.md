# Cyclistic
My Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Course

Scenario:

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

# Solution

The Cyclistic company is looking for answers... The finance team have come to the conclusion that the annual membership clients are more
profitable than the casual ones. So the main question is: How to convert these casual riders into membership clients?

First things first. Let's look at some data and recognize how they behave, look for differences and similarities on how they use the service.
